## Run locally

Type `yarn` to create `node_modules`. Because the build file is also uploaded for convenience of use, `yarn watch-build` is not necessary. If the build file is deleted or there is a problem, run the command.

After that, you can run the `vscode extension` by pressing the `F5` key. Press `ctrl + shift + P` in the newly opened VScode and enter the command below to auto complete.

The following warning message may be output. Just press `Debug anyway` and proceed.
